# ðŸŽ¯ Final Animation Attempt

## ðŸ”§ **Simplified Implementation**

I've created the simplest possible counting animation:

### **What Changed:**
- **Removed all complex logic** - Just basic intersection observer + setInterval
- **Simple counting** - Uses setInterval for reliable 60fps counting
- **Minimal dependencies** - No complex easing or requestAnimationFrame
- **Direct number display** - Simple toLocaleString() formatting

### **How It Works:**
1. **Intersection Observer** detects when element is 50% visible
2. **setInterval** counts up from 0 to target value at 60fps
3. **Simple math** - increment = endValue / (duration * 60)
4. **Direct update** - Updates state every frame until complete

### **Test Instructions:**
1. **Visit About Us page**
2. **Scroll to impact section**
3. **Numbers should count from 0 to target values**

### **If This Doesn't Work:**
- The issue is likely environmental (browser, React version, etc.)
- We should remove the animation feature entirely
- Use static numbers instead

## ðŸŽ¯ **Fallback Plan**

If this final attempt fails, we'll:
1. **Remove AnimatedNumber component**
2. **Replace with static numbers**
3. **Keep the beautiful styling**
4. **Move on to other features**

**This is the simplest possible implementation - if it doesn't work, the animation feature isn't viable in this environment.**
