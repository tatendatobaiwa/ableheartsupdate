# 🔧 Security Logging Fix

## 🚨 **Issue Identified**
Security events are being logged in development mode, causing console spam due to React StrictMode running effects twice.

## ✅ **Fix Applied**

### **1. Updated Security Logging Logic**
- **File**: `src/utils/securityEnhancements.js`
- **Change**: Added environment check to skip logging in development unless explicitly enabled
- **Benefit**: Clean development console, only logs when needed

### **2. Added Environment Variable**
- **File**: `.env.example`
- **Added**: `VITE_ENABLE_SECURITY_LOGGING=false`
- **Purpose**: Allow developers to enable security logging when debugging

## 🎯 **Behavior After Fix**

### **Development Mode (Default):**
- ✅ No security event logging
- ✅ Clean console output
- ✅ Better developer experience

### **Development Mode (With VITE_ENABLE_SECURITY_LOGGING=true):**
- 🔍 Security events logged for debugging
- 📊 Full security monitoring active

### **Production Mode:**
- 🛡️ All security events logged
- 📈 Full monitoring and reporting
- 🚀 Ready for security analysis

## 🔧 **How to Enable Security Logging in Development**

1. Create `.env` file (if not exists)
2. Add: `VITE_ENABLE_SECURITY_LOGGING=true`
3. Restart development server
4. Security events will now appear in console

## ✅ **Result**
- 🟢 Clean development experience by default
- 🟢 Optional security logging for debugging
- 🟢 Full production monitoring maintained
- 🟢 No more console spam in development
